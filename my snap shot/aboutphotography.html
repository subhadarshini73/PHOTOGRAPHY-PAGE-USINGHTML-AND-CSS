                    <h1><u><i>About Photography:-</i></u></h1>
                    <p><b><i>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating images by recording light, either electronically<br> by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic<br>film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as<br> well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass<br> communication.[1]

Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real<br> image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image<br> sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a<br> digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an<br> invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or<br> positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative<br> image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as<br> a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.
